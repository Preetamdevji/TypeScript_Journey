// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.
// using typescript
// Array of usernames
var usernames = ['admin', 'Arash', 'Masood', 'John', 'admin'];
// Loop through the array and print greetings
for (var _i = 0, usernames_1 = usernames; _i < usernames_1.length; _i++) {
    var username = usernames_1[_i];
    if (username.toLowerCase() === 'admin') {
        console.log('Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?');
    }
    else {
        console.log("Hello ".concat(username, ", thank you for logging in again."));
