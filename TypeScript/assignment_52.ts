// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface Car {
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any; 
}

function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...args: { [key: string]: any }[]): Car {
    const car: Car = { manufacturer, model };

    args.forEach(arg => {
        const [key, value] = Object.entries(arg)[0];
        car[key] = value;
    });

    return car;
}

const myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", { color: "blue" }, { year: 2023 });
console.log(myCar);
